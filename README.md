# mazeExplorations


Working on every once in a while making a program which takes in a picture of a maze and outputs the solution to it.

10/31/2021: I have gotten a very rough form of a picture scanner to work, as can be seen below.  
<img width="612" alt="mazeW:RedDots" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37377528/139597467-ecea3a7d-43e7-4527-8c61-a59feb2e6926.png">
Uses two for loops to go over the picture and where the red dots are in the picture, that is where it scans whats the pixel value at that point, detecting whether it is black or white. Then converts that over to an array which I am working on having an algorithm which maneuvers in that blocked grid.
